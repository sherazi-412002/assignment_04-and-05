            <div className='text-justify'>Physiology is the branch of biology that studies the functions and mechanisms of living organisms, 
              focusing on how their systems, organs, cells, and biomolecules work together to sustain life. This discipline encompasses a wide 
              range of topics, from the molecular and cellular levels to the integration of systems within whole organisms.In animals, physiology 
              examines processes such as respiration, circulation, digestion, and homeostasisâ€”the regulation of internal conditions despite 
              external changes. For instance, it explores how the heart pumps blood, how lungs facilitate gas exchange, and how kidneys filter 
              waste from the blood. In plants, physiology investigates processes like photosynthesis, nutrient uptake, and water regulation, 
              illustrating how plants adapt to their environments.</div>

            <p className='text-justify'>The nervous system is a complex network of cells and tissues that coordinates and regulates the functions 
              of the body by transmitting signals between different parts. It is responsible for processing sensory information, controlling 
              movements, and facilitating communication between various organs and systems. The nervous system can be broadly divided into two 
              main components: the central nervous system (CNS) and the peripheral nervous system (PNS).

              cells. Understanding DNA is essential for comprehending various physiological processes, including gene expression, protein synthesis,

            <p className='text-justify'>A neuron is a specialized cell that serves as the fundamental building block of the nervous system, responsible 
              for transmitting and processing information throughout the body. Neurons are unique in their ability to generate and propagate electrical 
              impulses, allowing for rapid communication between different parts of the body. They play a crucial role in various physiological functions, 
              including sensation, movement, thought, and reflexes.</p><br/>
